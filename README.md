# Image-Caption-Generator  

This Image Caption Generator project uses deep learning to create captions for images. Two models were developed: one with *VGG16* and another with *ResNet50* for feature extraction. These models generate descriptive captions by combining visual data with language processing, enhancing image interpretation capabilities.  

## Features  
- Supports two architectures for feature extraction: *VGG16* and *ResNet50*.  
- Utilizes pre-trained models for efficient feature extraction.  
- Implements an encoder-decoder framework combining CNNs and RNNs.  
- Generates human-readable captions describing the content of images.  
- Easy integration with custom datasets for diverse applications.  

## Technologies Used  
- *Python*  
- *TensorFlow*  
- *Keras*  
- *NumPy*  
- *Matplotlib*  
- *Pandas*
